# Write Actions: Safety Protocol

This file is **mandatory reading** before calling `pause_ad.py`, `update_budget.py`, `duplicate_ad.py`, or `create_campaign.py`. These scripts touch real money. A misread analysis or a confidently-wrong recommendation can pause a winning ad, 10x a losing budget, duplicate the wrong creative, or launch a campaign against the wrong landing page. There's no "undo" button — Meta will execute the change instantly and you'll be reconstructing the previous state from `effective_status` history if it goes wrong.

## The five non-negotiable rules

### 1. Explicit confirmation in chat for every single write

A previous "go ahead" or "yes do whatever you think" in the conversation does NOT count. Each individual write call needs its own confirmation message. The user has to actively re-affirm. This is friction by design — the friction is the safety feature.

What confirmation looks like, minimally:
- The user explicitly names the action (`yes pause it`, `confirm`, `כן תשנה`, `בצע`)
- It's the user's most recent message before the write call
- It's not just "ok" or "👍" in response to something else — it has to be unambiguous about the specific action

If you're unsure whether a message is a confirmation, treat it as not. Ask again.

### 2. Surface the impact before asking

Don't just say "should I pause ad 12345?" Say:

> Pause ad **`Summer_Launch_v3`** (ID `120214567890`)?
> - Spent ₪47.20 over the last 7 days
> - 0.8% CTR (vs your account avg 1.4%)
> - 12 link clicks, 0 conversions
> - Ad set still has 3 other ads delivering, so the ad set won't go dark
>
> Confirm with `yes` to proceed.

The user can only consent to what they understand. If you can't explain the impact in 3-5 lines, you don't understand it well enough to recommend the action.

### 3. One action per confirmation, by default

If the analysis suggests pausing 12 ads, don't bundle them into one mega-confirmation. Either:
- Walk through them one at a time (slower but safest), OR
- Present a numbered list of all 12 and explicitly ask for "pause all 12" or "pause #1, #3, #7" — accept partial selections

Never assume a previous batch confirmation extends to a new batch. If the user said "pause those 3 fatigued ads" and you found 5 more later in the conversation, the new 5 need their own confirmation.

### 4. Always dry-run when the script supports it

Every write script accepts `--dry-run`. Use it first when:
- This is the first write of the session
- The change is large (>50% budget swing, bulk pause, deep_copy duplications)
- You're acting on data you fetched more than 30 minutes ago (it might be stale)
- The user is testing the skill and hasn't done a write before

The dry-run output shows exactly what would change. Read it back to the user and ask for the real confirmation.

### 5. Never chain writes without intermediate verification

If the plan is "duplicate the winning ad, then pause the original" — don't run both as a single batch. Run the duplicate, fetch the new ID, confirm to the user that the duplicate is created and in the expected state, *then* ask to pause the original. Mid-chain failures are the worst kind: you can end up with the original paused and the duplicate broken, leaving the ad set with nothing delivering.

## Per-script safety notes

### `pause_ad.py`

- Status `PAUSED` stops delivery immediately. Spending stops within minutes (not seconds — there's a small in-flight auction tail).
- Status `ACTIVE` resumes. The ad re-enters the learning phase if it had been paused for >7 days.
- Pausing a campaign also stops all ad sets and ads under it; pausing an ad set stops only its ads.
- A paused ad in an active ad set with active sibling ads has no effect on overall delivery — Meta just shifts spend to the siblings. This is usually desirable.
- A paused ad in an ad set where it was the *only* active ad means the ad set goes dark. Surface this to the user before pausing.

### `update_budget.py`

- The 2x cap per call is a hard rule. To go from ₪50/day to ₪200/day, do it in steps: ₪50 → ₪100 → ₪175 → ₪200, with confirmations between. Override with `--allow-large-increase` only if the user explicitly says "yes I understand the risk, do the full 4x".
- Any change >20% triggers Meta's learning-phase reset. The script's output includes a `warning` field when this applies. Mention it to the user — they should expect 3-7 days of unstable performance after a big budget move.
- Decreases >50% can drive Meta to pause the ad set automatically because the budget is "too low to deliver". Watch for `effective_status: CAMPAIGN_PAUSED` in subsequent fetches.
- Lifetime budgets and daily budgets are mutually exclusive on a given object. The script auto-detects which is set; if both or neither are returned, it refuses to act.
- For campaign budget optimization (CBO) campaigns, budget lives at the campaign level, not the ad set. The script handles this correctly because it queries the object first, but be aware: passing an ad set ID for a CBO campaign will fail with a clear error.

### `duplicate_ad.py`

- Default `--status PAUSED` is the right default. Only override if the user explicitly wants the duplicate to go live immediately.
- `deep_copy=true` (used for campaigns) duplicates the entire tree — campaign, ad sets, ads, creatives. For a campaign with 5 ad sets and 20 ads, that's 26 new objects. Tell the user the count before duplicating.
- Duplicating an ad set into a different campaign (`--target-parent-id`) requires the target campaign to have a compatible objective. Mismatched objectives → API error.
- Naming: Meta's default suffix is " - Copy". Use `--rename` to keep the account organized — naming chaos compounds fast across iterations.
- Duplicate ≠ fresh creative. A duplicated ad is the same ad, just a new ID. It enters its own learning phase but the *creative* is identical. If the original is fatigued because of creative burnout, duplicating won't help — only new creative will.

### `create_campaign.py`

This is the newest and highest-blast-radius write. One `--confirm` run produces a campaign plus N ad sets plus M creatives plus M ads — typically 5-10+ new objects from a single command. Get it wrong and you're rolling back a tree of objects spread across Ads Manager.

- **Dry-run is not optional.** Before the first `--confirm` of any spec, run `--dry-run` and walk the full plan back to the user: campaign name, objective, identity (page + IG), every ad set's targeting and budget, every ad's headline and CTA. Only ask for confirmation after the user has seen this.
- **All objects default to PAUSED.** Don't override `status: ACTIVE` on creation unless the user has explicitly typed "create ACTIVE" or the equivalent in their language. The PAUSED default is a checkpoint — the user flips to ACTIVE in Ads Manager once they've eyeballed the creative, which catches problems the API can't (wrong image, weird Hebrew rendering, headline that looks fine at 40 chars in a spec but truncates ugly on mobile).
- **Never launch a conversions campaign against an account with no pixel.** Even if the user asks for `objective: OUTCOME_SALES`, if `/me/pixels` returns empty or no Purchase events have fired in 30+ days, refuse and explain why: Meta has nothing to optimize toward, spend will go to random clicks, and the campaign will look broken by week 2. Offer `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC` as the interim path. Document this decision to the user before proceeding.
- **Watch for `UNSETTLED` on the ad account.** `list_accounts.py` reports account status. If the account is unsettled, objects get created but nothing delivers. That's fine — surface it, don't block. Users typically want the structure in place while they clear the balance.
- **`special_ad_categories` matters.** If the campaign is for housing, employment, credit, or political/social issues, the spec MUST set the right category. Wrong category = total campaign rejection on review, with a Meta penalty counter. If the user's copy mentions loans, interest rates, job listings, or political figures, confirm the category before `--confirm`.
- **Creative review expects accurate claims.** Social proof numbers ("10,000+ enrolled"), ranking claims ("#1 in Israel"), guarantee language, celebrity endorsements — all get reviewed. Before `--confirm`, surface every numeric or superlative claim baked into the image or copy and ask the user whether it's truthful and provable. Fabricated social proof isn't just ethically bad — it gets the whole creative banned.
- **State file is the rollback surface.** Every `--confirm` writes `<spec>_state_<timestamp>.json` with every object ID in creation order. Keep it. If anything's wrong after creation, `rollback_creation.py --state <file> --pause` soft-stops everything in one call.
- **One campaign at a time.** Don't batch multiple `--confirm` calls. Each campaign is a separate spec, separate dry-run, separate explicit confirmation. This limits blast radius if the spec is broken.
- **Never chain create → activate.** If the user wants the campaign live immediately, that's a separate subsequent confirmation: create (PAUSED), verify the objects look right by fetching them back and reading creative previews, then call the activation as its own write.

## When something goes wrong

If you executed a write and the user wants to undo it:

- **Pause → Active rollback:** call `pause_ad.py --status ACTIVE` on the same ID. Note: if the ad was paused for >7 days, it re-enters learning.
- **Budget rollback:** call `update_budget.py` with the previous value. Each script's success output includes the previous value (`status_before`, `before_minor`) — capture these into the conversation context immediately so they're available for rollback.
- **Duplicate rollback:** the duplicate has a new ID returned in the output. To "undo," delete or pause the new copy. Deleting requires `delete()` on the meta_client — there's no bundled script because permanent deletion is risky; do it via the Meta UI unless the user really wants programmatic delete.

## What this skill will NOT help with

- **Bulk operations across accounts.** Each call is scoped to one ad account at a time. Multi-account bulk = multi-tenant work, wrong skill.
- **Editing existing creatives.** You can CREATE new creatives via `create_campaign.py` (link_data with image upload). Modifying the image or copy on an already-live creative is a different shape — Meta requires a new creative object and swap on the ad. Out of scope for v1.
- **Dynamic creative, catalog ads, collection ads.** `create_campaign.py` handles single-image link ads only. Those other formats use `asset_feed_spec`, `product_set_id`, or `template_data` — extend the script or write a sibling for them.
- **Custom Audience creation or modification.** You can USE existing Custom Audience IDs in `targeting.custom_audiences`, but building a new audience (from pixel events, customer lists, IG engagers, etc.) is a separate API surface and out of scope for v1.
- **Pixel / CAPI event manipulation.** Different API entirely (Conversions API), different auth, different mental model.
- **Scheduled writes.** This skill is on-demand. If the user wants "pause all ads with frequency >4 every Monday morning," that belongs in a scheduler (cron, a scheduled-tasks integration, etc.), not inside this skill.

## Scope note: personal-scale vs. agency / enterprise

This skill is built for personal-scale ad management — one operator, one set of credentials, a handful of ad accounts. At that scale individual writes matter and confirmations are easy.

If this ever gets pointed at multi-tenant use (an agency managing dozens of client Business Managers, or an in-house team acting on shared client accounts), the rules in this file are insufficient. You'd need per-client credential storage, an audit log of every write with operator identity, role-based access, and probably a four-eyes approval flow for anything above a threshold. Don't try to retrofit this skill — build a separate multi-tenant version. Each account owner should run their own setup with their own Meta app and their own System User token.
